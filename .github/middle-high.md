# What is "middle-high level"?

"Middle-high Level" is a home-brewed concept, which means this library provides high-level C/C++ interface alongside a backend written in pure C (so-called "middle-level language"), instead of low-level language such as [Assembly Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).
